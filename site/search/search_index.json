How is an image formed in the eye? When we look at object, light from object enters our eyes through cornea Cornea & lens & jelly-like fluid help focus (bend \u5f2f\u66f2) light onto retina Sharp \u6e05\u6670 & inverted \u5012\u7f6e\u7684 image is formed on retina. Light-sensitive cells on retina are stimulated \u53d7\u523a\u6fc0 by light \u2192 produce signals Signals are sent \u2192 brain through optic nerve. Brain then interprets \u5206\u6790 signals as upright image C. How do we see objects at different distances? 1. Looking at a near object focusing muscles contract \u6536\u7f29 lens becomes thicker light from the near object can be focused onto retina 2. Looking at a distant object focusing muscles relax lens becomes thinner light from the distant object can be focused onto retina D. How do we see colours? Cone cells 3 types each type is sensitive to one of 3 colours red green blue sensitive to bright light only work well in bright light enable us \u2192 see different colours Rod cells sensitive to dim light (can work in bright light) enable us \u2192 see when it's dark cannot detect colour (In dim light) only rod cells are stimulated & send signals \u2192 brain Difficult to distinguish colours in dark E. Limitations of human eyes 1. The limit of human vision cannot clearly see objects that are too small too close too far away scientists have invented different kinds of optical instrument \u5149\u5b66\u4eea\u5668 to help extend our vision Blind spot located on retina where optic nerve leaves eyeball no light-sensitive cells (when image of object is formed on the blind spot) no signals will be sent \u2192 brain cannot see object F. Common eye defects 1. Short sight & long sight Short sight cannot see distant objects clearly images of distant objects are formed in front of retina caused by lens being too thick eyeball being too long corrected by wearing glasses (concave lenses \u51f9\u9762\u955c) Long sight cannot see near objects clearly images of near objects are formed behind retina caused by lens being too thin eyeball being too short corrected by wearing glasses (convex lenses \u51f8\u9762\u955c) 2. Astigmatism \u6563\u5149 blurred vision \u6a21\u7cca because cornea / lens unevenly curved light from object cannot be focused onto the retina to form sharp image corrected by wearing glasses with lenses (have different curvatures \u5f27\u5ea6 at different points) 3. Cataract \u767d\u5185\u969c lens becomes cloudy some of the light cannot pass through to reach retina in blurred vision can lead to blindness reason in old age eye injuries \u773c\u75be prolonged exposure \u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u66b4\u9732 to sunlight heredity \u9057\u4f20 replaced with artificial \u4eba\u9020\u7684 lens through surgery \u5916\u79d1\u624b\u672f 4. Colour-blindness caused by defect in 1/ more types of cone cells affecting person's ability \u2192 distinguish colours e.g. red-green colour-blindness have difficulty in distinguishing between red & green inherited defect more common in males > females cannot be corrected C. Protecting our eyes After reading or using computer for 30-40 mins, rest your eyes by looking at distant distant objects Study in sufficient but not strong light. Keep an appropriate reading distance of about 30cm When you're using computer, the monitor should be placed 50-70 cm away from your eyes Wear safety goggles whenever there is a risk of hurting your eyes during experiments Have regular eye check-ups every year & correct eye defects as soon as possible Wear hat & sunglasses \u2192 protect your eyes from strong sunlight Don't read / write while bending over the desk Don't play mobile games while riding in moving vehicle Don't rub your eyes as this can increase the risk","title":"U.10.2 Sight"},{"location":"%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6/Unit%2010/U.10.2%20Sight/#a-the-main-parts-and-functions-of-the-eye","text":"\u5177\u4f53\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u56fe\u7247\u8bf7\u53c2\u7167\u6559\u79d1\u4e66","title":"A.
