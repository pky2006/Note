# U.10.2 Sight

# A. The main parts and functions of the eye

> 具体位置的图片请参照教科书

### Outside

- eyebrow 眼眉
    - prevent sweat from getting into the eyes
- eyelash 眼睫毛
    - prevent small particles (e.g. dust) from getting into the eyes
- eyelid 眼皮
    - can close to protect eyes from dirt & strong light
    - can blink → help moisten 湿润 eye surface
- socket of the skull
    - 80% eyeball is hidden inside
    - protect eyeball

### Inside

- focusing muscle 對焦肌肉
    - change the thickness of the lens
- cornea 角膜
    - let light pass through
- iris 虹膜
    - control the size of the pupil
- pupil 瞳孔
    - regulate the amount of light entering the eye
- lens 晶状体
    - let light pass through
    - help focus 聚焦 light
- jelly-like fluid 玻璃状液
    - maintain the shape of eyeball
    - help focus light
- sclera 巩膜
    - protect eyeball
- retina 视网膜
    - contain light-sensitive cells → detect light & produce signals
- blind spot 盲点
    - spot where optic nerve leaves eyeball
    - contain no light-sensitive cells
- optic nerve 视神经
    - transmit signals from light-sensitive cells → brain

# B. How is an image formed in the eye?

1. When we look at object, light from object enters our eyes through cornea
2. Cornea & lens & jelly-like fluid help focus (bend 弯曲) light onto retina
3. Sharp 清晰 & inverted 倒置的 image is formed on retina. Light-sensitive cells on retina are stimulated 受刺激 by light → produce signals
4. Signals are sent → brain through optic nerve. Brain then interprets 分析 signals as upright image

# C. How do we see objects at different distances?

## 1. Looking at a near object

- focusing muscles contract 收缩
- lens becomes thicker
    - light from the near object can be focused onto retina

## 2. Looking at a distant object

- focusing muscles relax
- lens becomes thinner
    - light from the distant object can be focused onto retina

# D. How do we see colours?

### Cone cells

- 3 types
    - each type is sensitive to one of 3 colours
        - red
        - green
        - blue
- sensitive to bright light
    - **only** work well in bright light
- enable us → see different colours

### Rod cells

- sensitive to dim light (can work in bright light)
- enable us → see when it's dark
- **cannot** detect colour

> (In dim light) only rod cells are stimulated & send signals → brain
Difficult to distinguish colours in dark

# E. Limitations of human eyes

## 1. The limit of human vision

- cannot clearly see objects that are
    - too small
    - too close
    - too far away
- scientists have invented different kinds of optical instrument 光学仪器
    - to help extend our vision

## Blind spot

- located on retina where optic nerve leaves eyeball
- no light-sensitive cells
- (when image of object is formed on the blind spot) no signals will be sent → brain
- cannot see object

---

# F. Common eye defects

## 1. Short sight & long sight

### Short sight

- cannot see distant objects clearly
    - images of distant objects are formed in front of retina
- caused by
    - lens being too thick
    - eyeball being too long
- corrected by wearing glasses (concave lenses 凹面镜)

### Long sight

- cannot see near objects clearly
    - images of near objects are formed behind retina
- caused by
    - lens being too thin
    - eyeball being too short
- corrected by wearing glasses (convex lenses 凸面镜)

## 2. Astigmatism 散光

- blurred vision 模糊
- because cornea / lens unevenly curved
    - light from object **cannot** be focused onto the retina to form sharp image
- corrected by wearing glasses with lenses (have different curvatures 弧度 at different points)

## 3. Cataract 白内障

- lens becomes cloudy
    - some of the light cannot pass through to reach retina
        - in blurred vision
- can lead to blindness
- reason
    - in old age
    - eye injuries 眼疾
    - prolonged exposure 长时间暴露 to sunlight
    - heredity 遗传
- replaced with artificial 人造的 lens through surgery 外科手术

## 4. Colour-blindness

- caused by defect in 1/ more types of cone cells
    - affecting person's ability → distinguish colours
    - e.g. red-green colour-blindness have difficulty in distinguishing between red & green
- inherited defect
    - more common in males > females
- cannot be corrected

# C. Protecting our eyes

- After reading or using computer for 30-40 mins, rest your eyes by looking at distant distant objects
- Study in sufficient but not strong light. Keep an appropriate reading distance of about 30cm
- When you're using computer, the monitor should be placed 50-70 cm away from your eyes
- Wear safety goggles whenever there is a risk of hurting your eyes during experiments
- Have regular eye check-ups every year & correct eye defects as soon as possible
- Wear hat & sunglasses → protect your eyes from strong sunlight
- Don't read / write while bending over the desk
- Don't play mobile games while riding in moving vehicle
- Don't rub your eyes as this can increase the risk
