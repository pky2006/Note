# U.10.3 Hearing

# A. Sound

## 1. How is the sound produced?

- by vibration

## 2. Frequency and pitch of sound

Frequency

- no. of vibrations **per second**
- unit : **hertz (Hz)** 赫兹
- ↑ sound frequency = ↑ pitch 音调

## 3. How is sound transmitted

- **must **travel through medium
    - solid
    - liquid
    - gas
    - ❌ vacuum 真空
    - transmitted through vibrations of particles

# B. How we hear

- outer ear 外耳
    - pinna耳壳
        - funnel 漏斗 shape
            - collect sound from surroundings 周围
                - direct sound into ear canal
    - ear canal 听道
        - sound travel down ear canal → middle ear
- middle ear 中耳
    - eardrum 耳膜
        - thin membrane 薄膜
        - sound causes eardrum to vibrate
            - transmitted → ear bones
    - 3 ear bones 听骨
        - amplify 扩大 vibrations of eardrum
            - transmitted to inner ear
- inner ear 內耳
    - cochlea 耳蝸
        - coiled structure 盘绕的结构
        - **sensory hair cell**
            - specialized 专门 sensory cells
                - detect vibrations
                - produce signals
    - auditory nerve 听神经
        - signals from sensory hair cells send → brain through auditory nerve
            - brain interprets 解释 signals → sound

### Process

1. Pinna collects sound from surroundings
2. Sound travels along the ear canal → middle ear
3. Sound causes eardrum to vibrate & transmitted → ear bones
4. 3 ear bones amplify the vibrations of eardrum & transmitted → inner ear
5. Sensory hair cells detect vibrations & produce signals
6. Signals sent through auditory nerve & brain interprets signals → sound

# C. Limitations of our ear

## 1. Audible frequency range 听频范围 of humans

- humans 20 Hz - 20 000 Hz
- different in diff people
    - upper limit in young > older people

## 2. Audible frequency range of other animals

- different range in diff animals
- **Example (Hz)**
    - bats
        - 10-100 000
    - dolpins
        - 1 000-100 000
    - dogs
        - 18-50 000
    - birds
        - 300-20 000
    - humans
        - 20-20 000
    - elephants
        - 5-12 000

# D. Noise pollution

## 1. What is noise

- unit : decibel (dB) 分贝
    - measure: decibel meter 分贝计

## 2. Effects of noise on our health

- 85 dB : harmful effects on hearing
    - depend 取决于 sound levels & duration of exposure 暴露
        - extremely high sound levels / prolonged 持续很久的 exposures to loud sound → tinnitus 耳鸣 / hearing loss 失聪

## Protecting our sense of hearing

1. keep volume low when using earphones
2. shorten time you stay in noise environment
3. if noise exposure is unavoidable 不可避免 , wear ear plugs 耳塞 / ear protectors 护耳器
4. ❌ pick your eyes with hard objects
